# GeneLab bioinformatics processing pipeline for 10X Chromium 3' single cell RNA-sequencing data

> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7111.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7111_Versions/GL-DPPD-7111.md) holds an overview and example commands for how GeneLab processes single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets. See the [Repository Links](#repository-links) descriptions below for more information. Processed data output files and a GeneLab data processing summary is provided for each GLDS dataset in the [GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) repository](https://genelab-data.ndc.nasa.gov/genelab/projects).**
