# Workflow change log

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/SW_AmpIllumina-A_1.0.1/Amplicon/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/SW_AmpIllumina-A)
- documentation links updated in config.yaml to match changes in host site
- added config file for multiqc to trim suffixes from sample names and not include paths in output report
- packaging multiqc html in with data dir in a zip to match what RNAseq workflow does
- restructured fastqc and multiqc rules using inheritance to reduce some redundancy
- added workflow version number to the top of the Snakefile
- fixed an issue with the taxonomy-and-counts.biom.zip file produced
  - while it could previously be unzipped at the command line, on some systems trying to unzip it through a browser was failing
  - it looks like this was due to there being relative paths involved during the initial zip
  - added the `-j` flag to drop them since there is no directory structure needed for this single file

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/SW_AmpIllumina-A_1.0.0/Amplicon/Illumina/Workflow_Documentation/SW_AmpIllumina-A)
- original workflow version
