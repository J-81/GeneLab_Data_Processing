# GeneLab pipelines for generating raw data

## About
[NASA GeneLab](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) has created standard pipelines for generating raw sequence data from libraries created [in-house](https://genelab.nasa.gov/genelab-sequencing-services/omics_data) using different library preparation methods/kits and sequenced on Illumina's NovaSeq instrument. Click on a library preparation method/kit below for more details.
