# GeneLab raw data generation for bulk RNAseq prepared with the Qiagen UPX kit


> **The document [`GL-DPPD-7108.md`](Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7108_Versions/GL-DPPD-7108.md) holds an overview and example commands for how GeneLab generates raw (bulk) RNA sequence data from libraries prepared [in-house](https://genelab.nasa.gov/genelab-sequencing-services/omics_data) using the [Qiagen UPX kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/next-generation-sequencing/rna-sequencing/three-rnaseq/qiaseq-upx-3-transcriptome-kits/). See the [Repository Links](#repository-links) descriptions below for more information. Raw data output files and processing protocol are provided for each GeneLab-generated GLDS dataset hosted in the [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/).**
